About Our Project #make header
The balance between sleep and school or work can
becomes extremely disrupted. 
Sleep is highly needed but often sacrificed in order to 
meet deadlines and complete work. Our project seeks to understand if this balance
between sleep and school or work is highly imbalanced or if people are generally able
to achieve a healthy amount of sleep. Therefore, our project is interested 
in exploring this relationship between Americans and the amount of sleep they get 
in order to derive findings regarding Americans and the amount they are spent working, 
sleeping, and their health as sleep impacts that tremendously.

Our Data Source #make header (bold it as well)
In order to answer these questions about the relationship between Americans
and sleep, we used data collected from 2003 to 2017 by American Time Use Survey
from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. The survey gathered data from a 
random sample of Americans of both sexes, ranging from ages 15 to 60 years and
over. Namely, the dataset provides information about the type of day respondents reported
sleeping, the average hours per day spent sleeping, the sex of the respondent,
their age range, the year the data was collected.

Our Major Questions for Our Data #make header/make bulleted list
- What are the differences in hours slept between days in general, 
weekends and holidays, and nonholiday weekends?
  We derived this information from the columns in the dataset that 
pertained to types of days and average hours slept per day to answer this question.
- What are the average number of hours slept by each age group over the 
period of 2003-2017?
  We used the average number of hours slept per day and the age groups to
answer this question.
- Generally, across sexes and age groups, what are the average hours of sleep
Americans getting from the years 2003 to 2017?
  We used data from the sexes, age groups, and average hours slept by per day from
our entire dataset to answer this question.
