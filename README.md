# Final Project

## **Domain of Interest**
Our group is interested in the domain of **sleep** because it is a topic that is highly relevant for college students and emerging adults entering the workforce. Many people maintain busy lives but often forget to balance it with proper sleep and behaviors that benefit sleep health.

From our research, we found three different data driven projects:

#### [Ready, set, snooze!](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/11-627-m/11-627-m2018029-eng.htm)
- This was a study conducted by the General Social Survey (2015) in Canada. Participants from 25-54 years of age were surveyed on sleep habits and measured satisfaction with their amount of sleep, the difference in the amount of sleep between genders, and the amount of stress people experience based on their hours of sleep.

#### [2019 Philips Global Sleep Survey](https://www.visualcapitalist.com/visualizing-worlds-sleeping-habits/)

- This study shows the sleeping habits of countries around the world. It also shows the average amount of time people of each country sleep for.

#### [Visualizing Caffeine & Bedtime](https://observablehq.com/@elibryan/caffeine-simulator)
- This interactive graph shows how caffeine persists throughout the day and how it might affect one’s quality of sleep.

With our topic of sleep, we seek to answer what the best practices for healthier sleep are, the frequency of unhealthy habits people practice before bed (looking at their phone, watching tv, etc.), and how people perceive their quality of sleep. Our group will gather data from surveys and a case study to find answers for all three of the questions we will investigate. Analyzing the responses people put will allow us to draw conclusions that will hopefully resolve our sleep related inquiries.

## **Finding Data**
### [Source 1](https://www.kaggle.com/mlomuscio/sleepstudypilot?select=SleepStudyData.csv)
_Number of rows_: 105  
_Number of columns_: 6  
This data was collected by Michael Lomuscio who teaches data science at an international boarding school in the U.S. The data he collected represents his student’s opinions on if they are receiving adequate sleep, hours a student slept, if their phone is within their reach while in bed, phone usage 30 minutes before they sleep, results from a Likert type scale based on how tired they are throughout the day, and if they eat breakfast or not.

### [Source 2](https://data.world/makeovermonday/2019w23/workspace/file?filename=Time+Americans+Spend+Sleeping.xlsx)
_Number of rows_: 945  
_Number of columns_: 8  
This data was collected by the American Time Use Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics by surveying a random sample of Americans ages 15 years and older. The participants were grouped by age group and sex. This data helps us analyze the differences in the amount of sleep Americans of different ages and sex get. With a focus on age and sex, we can better analyze the impact these variables have on the amount of sleep people get on average.

### [Source 3](https://www.kaggle.com/danagerous/sleep-data)
_Number of rows_: 887  
_Number of columns_: 8  
This data was collected by the case study of an individual with the Sleep Cycle iOS app. The data is composed of an individual’s sleep hours(start and end times), sleep quality, observations of some other physical conditions(steps in a day and heart rates), and consumption of caffeine throughout the day. This data helps us analyze how the different sleeping times, physical activities, and consumption of caffeine could impact an individual’s sleep hours and quality.
