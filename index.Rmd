Our group is interested in this domain because sleep is a topic that is highly relevant for college students and emerging adults entering the workforce. Many people maintain busy lives but often forget to balance it with proper sleep and behaviors that benefit sleep health.

The data in our dataset was collected by the American Time Use Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics by surveying a random sample of Americans ages 15 years and older. The participants were grouped by age group and sex. This data helps us analyze the differences in the amount of sleep Americans of different ages and sex get. With a focus on age and sex, we can better analyze the impact these variables have on the amount of sleep people get on average. 

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
