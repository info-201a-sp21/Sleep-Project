## Introduction

  Our group is interested in this domain because sleep is a topic that is highly relevant for college students and emerging adults entering the workforce. Many people maintain busy lives but often forget to balance it with proper sleep and behaviors that benefit sleep health.

  One of the data in our datasets was collected by the American Time Use Survey from the Bureau of Labor Statistics by surveying a random sample of Americans ages 15 years and older. The participants were grouped by age group and sex. This data helps us analyze the differences in the amount of sleep Americans of different ages and sex get. With a focus on age and sex, we can better analyze the impact these variables have on the amount of sleep people get on average and analyze the general trend of the average sleep hours of people.
  
  The data from Michael Lomuscio who teaches data science at an international boarding school in U.S. was also collected to analyze the factors that impact the student's sleep quality. This data represents his student's opinions on if they are receiving adequate sleep, hours a student slept,if their phone is within their reach while in bed, phone usage 30 minutes before they sleep, results from a Likert type scale based on how tired they are throughout the day, and if they eat breakfast or not.

## Summary Information

```{r summary_info, echo = FALSE}

summary_info <- get_summary_info(sleep_study_df)


```
  
  From the data by Michael Lomuscio who collected the data from students in international boarding school, our team founded that in average, students think that they get enough sleep when they slept `r summary_info[[1]]` hours. However, the average sleep hours for the phone-use group(the students who use phone within 30 minutes of falling asleep) was `r summary_info[[2]]`. For non-phone-use group(the students who do not use phone before falling asleep), the average sleep hours was `r summary_info[[3]]`. We could observethat both group do not reach to the ideal sleeping hours that students felt enough. With those two data points, we could also observe that the non-phone-use group had less sleeping hours than the phone-use group. However, 
  
  even though phone-use group slept more,
  
  their rate of agreeing with getting enough sleep was `r summary_info[[4]]`, while that of non-phone-use group was `r summary_info[[5]]`.
  
  
  
  the students who use phone within 30 minutes of falling asleep was `r summary_info[[2]]`, and for students who do not use phone before falling asleep was `r summary_info[[3]]`. We could observe that both group do not reach to the ideal sleep hours that students felt enough. With those two data poitns, we could also observe that the group who did not used phone had less sleeping hours that the group who used their phone. In contrast, even though the students who used their phone slept more, their rate of agreeing with getting enough sleep was `r summary_info[[4]]` while the non
  
  and who are not
  
  the average sleeping hours that people think
  `r summary_info[[1]]` something



## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
